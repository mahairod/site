This is my first post with jekyll.
Also trying use of ruby:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}!"
end
print_hi('Dear visitor')
{% endhighlight %}

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
